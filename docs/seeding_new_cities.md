#Seeding New Cities to the SafeWork Project Database
##Currently Supported Cities/Areas
- San Francisco, CA; In-depth relevant historical incident records

- Alameda County, CA (which includes Oakland); Some historical incidents. In depth records for the past 90 days.

- Santa Clara County, CA (which includes San Jose); Extremely sporatic and limited data

- Other Bay Area cities (Fremont, San Pablo, San Leandro); Some data, but not at all complete

- New York City, NY; Good amount of data, but it doesn't go back very far and its not at all comprehensive given NYC's population and history

###These cities are a priority to be added soon:
- Los Angeles, CA

- Chicago, IL

- Houston, TX

- Atlanta, GA

- Washington DC

- Detroit, MI

- New Orleans, LA

- Philidelphia, PA

##Finding the Appropriate City's Crime Data
- Only certain places in the country publish data that can be used in the SafeWork Project.

	- Even though Nevada has the highest sex work arrest rate per capita, as far as we can tell, they don't publish the individual incident reports.

	- In the Bay Area, San Francisco has in-depth historical incident data published going back to 2004. Alameda county has some historical incidents published, but always has the last 90 days' incidents published. Otherwise, the municipalities in the area are sporatic at best. This is the most typical.
